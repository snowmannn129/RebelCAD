# View Transition Manager

## Overview

The ViewTransitionManager provides smooth camera transitions between different view states in the RebelCAD viewport system. It handles interpolation of camera position, rotation, field of view, and projection type while supporting path planning and collision avoidance.

## Features

- Smooth view state interpolation
- Path planning with collision avoidance
- Custom easing functions
- Transition priority system
- Interruption handling
- Progress monitoring
- Event notifications

## Core Components

### View State

Represents a complete viewport state including:
- Camera position
- Camera rotation (quaternion)
- Field of view
- Target point
- Projection type
- Orthographic scale

### Transition Parameters

Configurable parameters for each transition:
- Duration
- Path planning enable/disable
- Interruption allowance
- Custom easing function
- Priority level

## Implementation Details

### State Interpolation

The system uses different interpolation methods for various state components:
- Position: Linear interpolation (or path-based if enabled)
- Rotation: Spherical linear interpolation (slerp)
- Scalar values: Linear interpolation
- Projection type: Discrete change at transition midpoint

### Path Planning

When enabled, path planning:
1. Generates intermediate points between start and end positions
2. Uses collision detection to avoid obstacles
3. Adjusts paths for smooth camera movement
4. Optimizes for shortest collision-free path

### Priority System

Transitions are managed based on priority:
- Higher priority transitions can interrupt lower priority ones
- Equal priority transitions queue sequentially
- Interrupted transitions can be resumed or cancelled

## Usage Examples

### Basic Transition

```cpp
// Create view states
ViewState start, end;
start.position = glm::vec3(0.0f);
end.position = glm::vec3(10.0f, 5.0f, 0.0f);

// Configure transition
TransitionParams params;
params.duration = 2.0f;
params.usePathPlanning = true;

// Start transition
uint64_t transitionId = transitionManager->startTransition(start, end, params);
```

### Custom Easing

```cpp
TransitionParams params;
params.duration = 1.0f;
params.easingFunc = [](float t) { 
    return t * t * (3.0f - 2.0f * t); // Smooth step
};
```

### Progress Monitoring

```cpp
transitionManager->setProgressCallback([](uint64_t id, float progress) {
    // Update UI or trigger events based on progress
});

transitionManager->setTransitionCompletedCallback([](uint64_t id) {
    // Handle transition completion
});
```

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management

- Active transitions are stored in a vector
- Completed transitions are automatically cleaned up
- Path points are only generated when path planning is enabled

### CPU Usage

- Interpolation calculations are optimized for SIMD
- Path planning is only performed at transition start
- Collision checks use spatial partitioning

### Threading

- Core update loop is thread-safe
- Callback functions are executed on the main thread
- Path planning can be performed asynchronously

## Integration Points

### Camera System

- Integrates with the viewport camera system
- Supports both perspective and orthographic projections
- Handles camera constraints and boundaries

### Collision System

- Uses the camera collision system for path planning
- Integrates with spatial partitioning
- Supports dynamic obstacle avoidance

### Event System

- Provides progress notifications
- Signals transition completion
- Enables external state monitoring

## Best Practices

1. **Path Planning**
   - Enable for complex scene navigation
   - Disable for simple view changes
   - Consider scene complexity when setting step size

2. **Transition Duration**
   - Use longer durations for large position changes
   - Keep short for responsive UI
   - Consider distance and visual complexity

3. **Priority Management**
   - Use higher priority for user-initiated transitions
   - Lower priority for automatic camera movements
   - Consider interaction patterns

4. **Error Handling**
   - Check transition IDs for validity
   - Handle interrupted transitions gracefully
   - Provide fallback paths for collision cases

## Future Improvements

1. **Advanced Features**
   - Multi-point path planning
   - Bezier curve paths
   - Dynamic path adjustment
   - Transition queuing system

2. **Optimization**
   - Path caching
   - Predictive collision detection
   - Parallel path calculation
   - Memory pool for transitions

3. **Integration**
   - Animation system support
   - Camera constraint system
   - Advanced easing library
   - State persistence
