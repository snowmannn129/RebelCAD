# Ray Casting System

## Overview
The Ray Casting System provides efficient and thread-safe object picking capabilities for RebelCAD. It integrates with the Scene Graph and Spatial Partitioning systems to enable fast and accurate object selection.

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### Ray
- Represents a ray in 3D space with origin and direction
- SIMD-optimized with 16-byte alignment
- Provides utility methods for point calculation

#### RaycastHit
- Stores intersection test results
- Contains hit position, normal, distance
- References intersected SceneNode
- Tracks front/back face information

#### RaycastManager
- Manages ray casting operations
- Integrates with spatial partitioning
- Supports multi-threaded ray casting
- Handles screen-to-world ray conversion

### Integration Points

#### Scene Graph
- Uses SceneNode's built-in intersection testing
- Leverages node transformation hierarchy
- Supports hierarchical picking

#### Spatial Partitioning
- Accelerates ray intersection tests
- Reduces number of intersection checks
- Maintains spatial coherence

## Implementation Details

### Performance Optimizations

1. Spatial Acceleration
   - Uses octree-based spatial partitioning
   - Early exit for non-intersecting regions
   - Efficient broad-phase collision detection

2. SIMD Operations
   - Aligned vector operations
   - Optimized ray-AABB tests
   - Vectorized intersection checks

3. Multi-threading
   - Parallel ray casting support
   - Thread-safe result caching
   - Lock-free operations where possible

### Thread Safety

1. Result Management
   - Atomic operations for critical updates
   - Thread-local storage for intermediate results
   - Safe concurrent ray casting

2. Resource Access
   - Read-only scene access during casting
   - Thread-safe spatial queries
   - Synchronized acceleration updates

## Usage Examples

### Basic Ray Cast
```cpp
// Create ray from camera
Ray ray = RaycastManager::screenPointToRay(
    mouseX, mouseY,
    viewportWidth, viewportHeight,
    viewProjectionMatrix
);

// Perform ray cast
RaycastHit hit = raycastManager.castRay(ray);

// Check for hit
if (hit.node) {
    // Handle object selection
    hit.node->setSelected(true);
}
```

### Multi-Ray Casting
```cpp
// Create multiple rays
std::vector<Ray> rays;
rays.push_back(ray1);
rays.push_back(ray2);

// Cast all rays in parallel
std::vector<RaycastHit> hits = raycastManager.castRays(rays);

// Process results
for (const auto& hit : hits) {
    if (hit.node) {
        // Handle hit
    }
}
```

## Performance Guidelines

### Best Practices

1. Spatial Partitioning
   - Keep acceleration structure updated
   - Balance partition depth vs overhead
   - Consider object distribution

2. Ray Casting
   - Use maxDistance parameter when possible
   - Batch multiple rays for better performance
   - Leverage parallel processing for large batches

3. Memory Management
   - Reuse ray and hit objects
   - Clear result cache periodically
   - Monitor memory usage in parallel operations

### Common Pitfalls

1. Performance
   - Excessive ray casts per frame
   - Deep scene hierarchies
   - Unbalanced spatial partitioning

2. Accuracy
   - Numerical precision issues
   - Missing intersection edge cases
   - Incorrect transform handling

3. Threading
   - Race conditions in result handling
   - Deadlocks in nested operations
   - Thread contention on shared resources
