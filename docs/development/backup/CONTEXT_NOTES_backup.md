# Development Context Notes

## Current Development Context

### Active Development
- **Module**: Core Infrastructure - Memory Management
- **Feature**: Memory Pool Optimization
- **Branch**: feature/memory-pool-optimization
- **Status**: In Progress

### Critical Implementation Details
```cpp
// Key architectural decisions
- Using free list for memory block management
- Implementing thread-safe operations with std::mutex
- Using atomic operations for counters
- Custom allocator support for STL containers
```

### Recent Changes
1. Implemented basic pool structure
2. Added custom deleter for smart pointers
3. Set up memory leak detection system
4. Created initial thread safety mechanisms

### Known Issues
1. Memory fragmentation occurring in long operations
2. Thread contention on pool mutex
3. Cache performance needs optimization
4. Reference counting overhead in smart pointers

### Design Decisions
1. Chose free list over bitmap allocation for flexibility
2. Using mutex over lock-free for initial implementation
3. Implementing custom allocator for STL container support
4. Decided on block-based over slab allocation

### Dependencies
- Smart Resource Management (operational)
- Memory Pool System (in progress)
- Garbage Collection (pending)
- Memory Leak Detection (operational)

### Performance Considerations
1. Cache line alignment for block headers
2. Minimizing lock contention
3. Optimizing allocation patterns
4. Reducing memory fragmentation

## Handoff Information

### Current Task State

## Technical Notes

### Memory Pool Architecture
```
Block Structure:
[Header][Payload]
Header: {size, used, next}
Alignment: 16-byte boundary
```

### Thread Safety Strategy
- Mutex for block allocation
- Atomic operations for counters
- Lock-free operations where possible

### Performance Optimization Plans
1. Implement block coalescing
2. Add memory compaction
3. Optimize cache usage
4. Reduce lock contention

### Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for core functionality
2. Stress tests for thread safety
3. Performance benchmarks
4. Memory leak detection

4. Container allocators

### Scalability Concerns
1. Thread contention at scale
2. Memory fragmentation over time
3. Cache performance
4. Resource limits
