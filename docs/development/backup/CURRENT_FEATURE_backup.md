# Current Feature: Memory Pool Optimization

## Implementation Status
Currently implementing the following components:

### Memory Pool Core
- [x] Basic pool structure
- [ ] Block allocation strategy
- [ ] Memory alignment handling
- [ ] Thread-safe operations

### Smart Pointer Integration
- [x] Custom deleter implementation
- [ ] Reference counting optimization
- [ ] Circular reference detection
- [ ] Weak pointer support

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Cache-friendly memory layout
- [ ] Allocation grouping
- [ ] Defragmentation strategy
- [ ] Memory compaction

## Current Task
Implementing block allocation strategy with the following requirements:
- Variable block sizes
- Minimal fragmentation
- Fast allocation/deallocation
- Thread safety

## Technical Details
```cpp
// Current implementation focus
class MemoryPool {
    struct Block {
        size_t size;
        bool used;
        Block* next;
    };
    
    // Key components being implemented
    Block* freeList;
    std::mutex poolMutex;
    std::atomic<size_t> totalAllocated;
};
```

## Known Issues
1. Memory fragmentation in long-running operations
2. Thread contention on pool mutex
3. Cache misses in allocation patterns
4. Reference counting overhead

## Next Implementation Steps
1. Complete block allocation strategy
2. Implement memory alignment
3. Add thread-safe operations
4. Optimize reference counting

## Testing Focus
- Memory leak detection
- Performance benchmarking
- Thread safety validation
- Edge case handling

## Dependencies
