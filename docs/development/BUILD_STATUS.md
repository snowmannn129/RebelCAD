## Build Prerequisites

1. **Required Tools**
   - CMake 3.31.5 or higher
   - Visual Studio with C++20 support
   - PowerShell for dependency scripts
   - Git for version control

2. **Dependencies**
   - All external dependencies appear to be properly configured
   - Build scripts (download_glad.ps1, download_imgui.ps1) present

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Complete core module implementations
   - Establish minimal working viewport
   - Create basic UI framework
   - Implement simple file I/O

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Continue unit test development
   - Implement integration tests
   - Create build verification tests

3. **Documentation**
   - Maintain build status updates
   - Document build procedures
   - Track resolved issues

This status is expected for a complex CAD system in early development. Focus should remain on completing core functionality before attempting to create a functional preview build.
