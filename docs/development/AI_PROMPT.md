# RebelCAD AI Development Prompt

Continue development of RebelCAD according to the tracking system in docs/development/. First review BUILD_STATUS.md to ensure development aligns with current build priorities and blockers. Then review the current module, feature, and context from the tracking files before proceeding with implementation following the AI Development Strategy.

Key priorities:
1. Verify each step against BUILD_STATUS.md critical path items
2. Focus on completing core functionality before new features
3. Ensure all implementations contribute to achieving a minimal viable executable
4. Follow test-driven development practices
5. Document any new build-related challenges or blockers

This ensures development remains focused on establishing a functional preview while maintaining architectural integrity.
