# RebelCAD Weekly Progress Report - March 21, 2025

## Overview

This week, we focused on implementing the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) system for RebelCAD. The FEA system is a core component that provides structural analysis capabilities, allowing users to analyze the mechanical behavior of 3D models under various loading conditions.

## Accomplishments

### FEA System Implementation

- **Core Framework**: Implemented the core FEA framework, including the main FEA system, materials, mesh handling, boundary conditions, loads, and result processing.
  
- **Material Library**: Created a comprehensive material library with common engineering materials (steel, aluminum, titanium, concrete, etc.) and support for isotropic, orthotropic, and elasto-plastic material models.
  
- **Mesh Generation**: Implemented basic mesh generation capabilities for tetrahedral and hexahedral elements, with support for mesh quality evaluation.
  
- **Boundary Conditions**: Added support for various boundary conditions, including fixed constraints and prescribed displacements.
  
- **Loads**: Implemented different load types, including point forces, surface pressures, and body forces.
  
- **Result Handling**: Created a robust system for processing and visualizing analysis results, including displacements, stresses, and strains.

- **Static Analysis Solver**: Implemented a robust linear static analysis solver using the finite element method. The solver includes:
  - Efficient assembly of the global stiffness matrix using sparse matrix representation
  - Application of boundary conditions using the penalty method
  - Solution of the system of equations using a direct sparse solver
  - Computation of displacements, stresses, strains, and reaction forces
  - Support for various element types (tetrahedral, hexahedral)
  - Comprehensive error handling and progress reporting

### Build System

- Set up CMake configuration for easy building and integration
- Created build scripts for Windows and Linux/macOS
- Configured the project for cross-platform compatibility

### Documentation

- Wrote comprehensive documentation for the FEA system
- Created a README file with build instructions and usage examples
- Added API documentation for all classes and methods

## Technical Details

### Classes Implemented

1. **FEASystem**: The main entry point for the FEA functionality. It manages the overall simulation process, including material registration, boundary condition and load application, and solving the FEA problem.

2. **Material**: Defines the material properties used in the analysis. Supports isotropic, orthotropic, and elasto-plastic material models.

3. **Mesh**: Represents the discretized geometry for analysis. Handles mesh generation, refinement, and quality evaluation.

4. **BoundaryCondition**: Defines constraints on the model, including fixed constraints and prescribed displacements.

5. **Load**: Defines forces and pressures applied to the model, including point forces, surface pressures, and body forces.

6. **FEAResult**: Contains the results of the analysis, including displacements, stresses, and strains.

7. **LinearStaticSolver**: Implements the linear static analysis solver using the finite element method. This class handles the assembly of the global stiffness matrix, application of boundary conditions, solution of the system of equations, and computation of results.

### Test Program

Implemented a test program (`FEATest.cpp`) that demonstrates the functionality of the FEA system. The test program:

1. Initializes the FEA system
2. Creates a simple mesh
3. Applies materials, boundary conditions, and loads
4. Solves the FEA problem
5. Displays the results

## Next Steps

For the next week, we plan to:

1. **Implement Nonlinear Analysis**: Add support for nonlinear material models and geometric nonlinearity.

2. **Add Thermal Analysis**: Extend the FEA system to support thermal analysis, including heat transfer and thermal-structural coupling.

3. **Improve Mesh Generation**: Enhance the mesh generation capabilities with adaptive refinement and improved quality metrics.

4. **Integrate with UI**: Connect the FEA system with the RebelCAD user interface for interactive analysis setup and result visualization.

5. **Add More Element Types**: Implement additional element types, such as shell and beam elements.

## Conclusion

The implementation of the FEA system represents a significant milestone for RebelCAD. It provides a solid foundation for structural analysis capabilities and sets the stage for more advanced features in the future.
