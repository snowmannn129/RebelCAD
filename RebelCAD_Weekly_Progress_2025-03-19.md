# RebelCAD Weekly Progress Report

## Week of March 13, 2025 - March 19, 2025

### Summary
This week marked the beginning of the implementation of the comprehensive tracking system for RebelCAD. We've established the tracking framework, created templates, and set up the roadmap for development. The core graphics engine components (spatial partitioning, ray casting, viewport, and camera systems) are stable and well-documented. Basic shape creation and editing in the sketching engine are functional. Memory leak detection is operational, but the memory management system still requires significant work.

### Key Achievements
1. Established comprehensive tracking system for RebelCAD development
2. Created detailed feature checklist with 228 items across all categories
3. Developed completion roadmap with phased approach and priorities
4. Set up final goal tracking with technical implementation priorities
5. Confirmed stability of existing graphics engine components

### Challenges & Solutions
1. **Memory Management Issues**: Current implementation shows memory leaks in complex operations. Solution: Design a comprehensive memory pool system with smart pointer integration.
2. **Constraint Solver Complexity**: Initial research shows this will be more complex than anticipated. Solution: Investigate existing open-source constraint solvers that could be adapted.
3. **Integration Planning**: RebelSUITE integration will require careful coordination. Solution: Begin early discussions with other component teams to establish integration requirements.

### Next Week's Focus
1. Begin memory pool implementation
2. Start scene serialization design
3. Research constraint solving algorithms
4. Design project file structure
5. Create unit testing framework

### Resource Allocation
- **Graphics Team**: Focus on scene serialization design
- **Core Systems Team**: Begin memory pool implementation
- **UI Team**: Document existing sketching tools
- **Research Team**: Investigate constraint solving algorithms

### Risk Updates
- **New Risk**: Constraint solver complexity may impact timeline for sketching engine completion
- **Mitigation**: Begin research and prototyping early, consider using existing libraries
- **Risk Reduction**: Graphics engine components are more stable than initially assessed

### Notes & Action Items
- Schedule technical design meeting for memory management system (Action: Team Lead)
- Create prototype for constraint solver by end of month (Action: Research Team)
- Begin documentation of existing code base (Action: Documentation Team)
- Set up automated testing infrastructure (Action: QA Team)

### Technical Debt Management
- Identified need for better documentation in spatial partitioning system
- Ray casting system needs performance optimization for large scenes
- Camera system needs better abstraction for different view types

### Performance Metrics
- Memory usage during typical operations: 450MB
- CPU utilization during viewport operations: 15-20%
- Load time for test models: 2.3 seconds
- Rendering performance: 60fps for test scenes
