- Progress by Phase
- Updated Overall Progress
- Key Achievements
- Challenges & Solutions
- Next Week's Focus
- Resource Allocation
- Risk Updates
- Notes & Action Items

**How to Use**: At the beginning of each week, make a copy of this template and fill it out with the progress made during the previous week. Save it with the naming convention `RebelCAD_Weekly_Progress_YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

### 5. RebelCAD_Task_Assignment_Template.md

**Purpose**: Provides a template for sprint task assignments.

**Key Sections**:
- Active Team Members
- Task Assignments
- Immediate Focus Tasks
- Blocked Tasks
- Code Review Assignments
- Testing Assignments
- Documentation Assignments
- Sprint Goals
- Progress Tracking
- Communication Channels

**How to Use**: At the beginning of each sprint, make a copy of this template and fill it out with the tasks for the upcoming sprint. Assign tasks to team members, set deadlines, and define dependencies. Save it with the naming convention `RebelCAD_Task_Assignments_Sprint_[Number].md`.

### 6. RebelCAD_Progress_Tracker.md (Existing)

**Purpose**: Provides a detailed tracking of development progress for RebelCAD.

**Key Sections**:
- Backup Standard
- Core Systems Status
- Feature Implementation Status
- Critical Issues
- Development Infrastructure

**How to Use**: This document has been integrated into the new tracking system. It will continue to be updated with detailed implementation status, but the high-level tracking will be managed through the other tracking documents.

## Workflow for Using These Documents

### Initial Setup
1. Define the final goal for RebelCAD v1.0 (RebelCAD_Final_Goal_Tracking.md)
2. Create a detailed feature checklist (RebelCAD_Feature_Checklist.md)
3. Develop a completion roadmap (RebelCAD_Completion_Roadmap.md)
4. Set up templates for progress tracking (RebelCAD_Weekly_Progress_Template.md)
5. Set up templates for task assignments (RebelCAD_Task_Assignment_Template.md)

### Ongoing Process
1. **Sprint Planning (Every 2 Weeks)**
   - Create a new task assignment document using the template
   - Assign tasks to team members
   - Set deadlines and dependencies
   - Define sprint goals

2. **Weekly Progress Tracking**
   - Create a new weekly progress report using the template
   - Update progress for each phase
   - Recalculate overall completion percentages
   - Identify key achievements and challenges
   - Define focus areas for the next week

3. **Feature Completion**
   - When a feature is completed, update the feature checklist
   - Recalculate completion percentages
   - Update the final goal tracking document
   - Update the progress tracker with implementation details

4. **Risk Management**
   - Regularly review and update the risk assessment
   - Implement mitigation strategies for identified risks
   - Document new risks as they arise

5. **Release Preparation**
   - Verify all release criteria are met
   - Conduct final testing and quality assurance
   - Prepare release documentation

## Conclusion

This tracking system provides a comprehensive framework for monitoring the progress of RebelCAD v1.0 development. By following the processes outlined in these documents, the team can ensure that all requirements are met and that the project stays on track for successful completion.

The ultimate goal is to deliver a fully functional, production-ready RebelCAD v1.0 that meets all the requirements and provides a seamless CAD experience for users.
